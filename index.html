        Convex Programming for ℋ∞ System Identification 
      </h2>
      <p>
        For robots with compliant actuators, feedback controllers are often designed to be energetically passive as a conservative heuristic for stability. To go beyond this performance limit is possible, but the new limit is based on model reliability. I propose to use ℋ∞ robust control theory to reach this limit, but the identification of ℋ∞ models turns out to be the real challenge. I've recently discovered that convex optimization can be used to identify robust models—and that robust models which include a list of frequency domain measurements can be a convex set. This may well yield a modeling technique which can predict the reliability-based limit for compliant robot actuators.

        Stability of Tendon-Driven Robotic Hand Systems
      </h3>
      <p>
        Fellow graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raobotics">Prashant Rao</a> of the <a href="http://www.me.utexas.edu/~reneu/">ReNeu</a> lab and I have been working to explain the instability that crops up in robotic hands driven by tendons using the framework of passivity. Look for us at ICRA 2017 in Singapore!

      <h2>
        Computationally Efficient Multi-Contact Locomotion Planning
      </h2>
      <p>
        This project explores a numerically efficient planning strategy for legged robots. Luis and I propose to decompose the kinodynamic planning problem into a geometric search for center of mass paths and a dynamic verification of the center of mass path. Geometric search is more tractible than kinodynamic search, and geometric search with an additional feasibility/cost function computation is not all that different from geometric search with obstacles. It also is beneficial to search in a low dimensional space, like center of mass paths, since the curse of dimensionality makes it hard to search larger spaces. But this all hinges on the simplicity of a dynamic check and cost evaluation procedure, which is what we focus on. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7759571/"><b>[IROS 2016 Paper]</b></a>

      <p> 
        What we call the "dynamic optimization" includes the selection of foot steps and hand-holds from a finite list of possible contacts as well as the velocity profile over the center of mass path. Our approach bears similarity both to phase space locomotion planning techniques for bipedal walking and the minimum time trajectory scaling problem for robot arms. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm's efficiency is its use of linear programming with reuse of the active set of inequality constraints—an emerging trend. The videos give some hint at the algorithm, but the paper is still your best bet.

        Point Foot Biped Robot Hume: Attitude Estimator
      </h3>

      <p> Figs: The Hume Robot uses red LED position markers which are (approximately) located by ceiling mounted cameras in the lab. The right video shows the orientation estimator tracking simulated movements. </p>
      
      <p>
      My data fusion algorithm tracks the robot torso pose implied by a noisy stream of led data. The algorithm is designed to handle occasional data ommisions, since the cameras do not reliably find all the LEDs. The filter does not spend cycles maintaining a covariance estimate like the Kalman filter, but it does acknoledge that the belief in current knowledge must be weighed against the information content of each set of detected LEDs: fusing the data via weighted least squares naturally downplays frames with few LEDs detected, and if the LEDs are sparse enough to leave geometric ambiguity, then the algorithm will naturally rely on the past data. A state of the art eigenvalue algorithm is used to cast the direction cosine matrix to a quaternion (and then back), to ensure validity of the rotation without sacrificing the linearity of the least squares problem.
