      <h3>
        High Performance Control of Series Elastic Robots
      </h3>
      <p>
        For robots with series elastic actuators (SEAs) feedback controllers are often designed to be energetically passive as a conservative heuristic for stability. To go beyond this performance limit is possible, but requires knowledge of the environment. If perfect knowledge is available then the SEA-environment system can be made to have almost any closed loop behavior, but this isn't a realistic scenario since all models are at least slightly inaccurate. I aim to apply my robust model-set identification technique alongside LMI-based ℋ∞ controller synthesis to the NASA Valkyrie Robot's elastic actuators in order to achieve control performance that beats the current state of the art.

      <h3>
        Uncertain State Feedback 
      </h3>
      <p> One fameously difficult problem in control theory is the optimal synthesis of static output feedback controllers. This problem is known to be NP-hard, which is unfortunate, since this problem is equivalent to optimally tuning PID controllers, state feedback controllers based on fixed state estimators, and low-order controller design in general. In this line of research, I'm pursuing a problem which is somewhere in between the convex full state feedback synthesis problem and the NP-hard static output feedback problem: uncertain state feedback. The uncertain state feedback problem is a special case of the static output feedback problem in which the output is an imperfect measurement of the full state. This is a complication relative to full state feedback, which assumes non-uncertain state feedback. The LMI synthesis problem from full state feedback synthesis becomes non-linear, but still permits a Q, Y change of variables, unlike the equivalent BMI from SOF.

      <h3>
        Optimal Force Control for Amplification Exoskeletons
      </h3>
      <p>  Amplification exoskeletons are designed to extend the capabilities of the human operator by amplifying their interaction forces with the world. Using force sensorized attachments between the human and the exoskeleton, this research seeks a control law which causes the human to feel a reduced environmental impedance regardless of joint or contact configuration, and it investigates the stability of such controllers under assumptions of unmodeled dynamics and uncertain human admittance.

      <h3>
        Barrier Pairs and Safety Controllers
      </h3>
      <p>  When hardware inputs are provided by untrusted sources, how can we guarantee the hardware will satisfy safety constraints? To answer this question I have, along with Binghan He, devised a backup safety controller which uses a minimum over quadratic lyapunov functions to determine when to switch to backup safety mode, and which control law to apply when it does so. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10188.pdf">[ArXiv]</a>

      <h3>
        Trajectory Optimization for Series Elastic Robots
      </h3>
      <p>  Series elastic robots typically have fairly linear actuator dynamics compared to their joint dynamics. To exploit this in trajectory optimization, Rachel Schlossman and I designed an iterative linear programming based trajectory optimizer which uses trust regions only for the robot impedance portion of the problem. See our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10190.pdf">ArXiv pre-print</a>, submitted to IEEE IROS 2018 in Madrid, for details.

      <h3>
        Robust ℋ∞ Model-Set Identification 
      </h3>
      <p>
        All control design problems are limited at high frequencies — roll-off constraints, passivity requirements, robust internal stability, cost function penalties on input, and margin requirements all methods for incorporating this reality into a design problem. These constraints all work against performance, so less conservative constraints are better. I've come to respect the philosophy that robust internal stability is the most fundamental of these limits. And since robust internal stability is based on a model-set description of the plant, I've designed an identification procedure which attempts to directly learn model-sets, specifically the additive uncertainty model-set from traditional ℋ∞ robust control theory, from single harmonic input output data <a href="http://walk-man.eu/results/workshops/iros-2016-workshop-force-torque-controlled-actuation/submitted-contribution/57-submission-by-gray-thomas/file"><b>[IROS 2016 WS]</b></a>.  The approach is parallel to other methods of system identification (prediction error, FFT-based, iterative identification for control) due to different assumptions on the nature of the identification experiment <a href="Preprints/ThomasSentis2017ACC.pdf"><b>[ACC 2017]</b></a>. It also benefits from a convex formulation which represents the model-set geometrically as a high dimensional generalization of a cone, a degenerate quadric, which makes the identification problem tractable.
          <!-- <a href="Preprints/ThomasSentis2017preTAC.pdf">[pre-print]</a> -->
        <!-- In our upcoming paper we provide a deep mathematical exploration of model learning at a single frequency. We prove the existence of an isomorphism between the three-tuple of model matrices and a single big matrix. We give geometric insight for this new parameterization, and prove that it is a convex space. We define a concept of model width and prove that it can be used to identify models in a far more complex convex optimization problem than before. We prove that in the limit as every possible behavior of the true model is explored, the identified model matches the true model. We additionally motivate a noise-robustness modification which protects the identification strategy from sensor noise. -->

        Stability of Elastic-Tendon-Driven Robotic Hands
      </h3>
      <p>
        Fellow graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raobotics">Prashant Rao</a> of the <a href="http://www.me.utexas.edu/~reneu/">ReNeu</a> lab and I explained the stiffness limits for robotic hands driven by series-elastic tendons, using a passivity framework. This research is Prashant's baby, but I was able to help put his ideas into a rigorous mathematical proof by introducing the passivity framework, segregating linear sub-spaces of motion and force, and ultimately re-deriving his empirical positive definiteness condition under those assumptions. I also came up with a second bound on the minimum passively achievable stiffness which isn't noticeable in Prashant's hardware; the bound only exists once a parallel stiffness is added to the system. Prashant gave a great presentation at ICRA 2017 in Singapore, featuring many of his latest demo-videos and results on Cartesian stiffness, and we landed the best manipulation paper award <a href="Preprints/RaoThomasSentisDeshpande2017ICRA.pdf"><b>[ICRA 2017]</b></a>!

      <h3>
        Computationally Efficient Multi-Contact Locomotion Planning
      </h3>
      <p>
        This project explores a numerically efficient planning strategy for legged robots. Luis and I propose to decompose the kinodynamic planning problem into a geometric search for center of mass paths and a dynamic verification of the center of mass path. Geometric search is more tractable than kinodynamic search, and geometric search with an additional feasibility/cost function computation is not all that different from geometric search with obstacles. It also is beneficial to search in a low dimensional space, like center of mass paths, since the curse of dimensionality makes it hard to search larger spaces. But this all hinges on the simplicity of a dynamic check and cost evaluation procedure, which is what we focus on. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7759571/"><b>[IROS 2016 Paper]</b></a>

      <p> 
        What we call the "dynamic optimization" includes the selection of foot steps and hand-holds from a finite list of possible contacts as well as the velocity profile over the center of mass path. Our approach bears similarity both to phase space locomotion planning techniques for bipedal walking and the minimum time trajectory scaling problem for robot arms. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm's efficiency is its use of linear programming with reuse of the active set of inequality constraints—an emerging trend. The videos give some hint at the algorithm, but the paper is still your best bet.

      In 2013 I worked with Donghyun Kim and Ye Zhao, as well as our advisor Luis Sentis, to control our series elastic biped robot. My focus was on real-time latency reduction, attitude estimation, and footstep planner theory.

      <p> Figs: The Hume Robot uses red LED position markers which are (approximately) located by ceiling mounted cameras in the lab. The right video shows the orientation estimator tracking simulated movements. My data fusion algorithm tracks the robot torso pose implied by a noisy stream of led data. The algorithm is designed to handle occasional data omissions, since the cameras do not reliably find all the LEDs. The filter does not spend cycles maintaining a covariance estimate like the Kalman filter, but it does acknowledge that the belief in current knowledge must be weighed against the information content of each set of detected LEDs: fusing the data via weighted least squares naturally downplays frames with few LEDs detected, and if the LEDs are sparse enough to leave geometric ambiguity, then the algorithm will naturally rely on the past data. A state of the art eigenvalue algorithm is used to cast the direction cosine matrix to a quaternion (and then back), to ensure validity of the rotation without sacrificing the linearity of the least squares problem. </p>

        The DARPA Robotics Competition's initial round, a virtual robotics competition in the simulation engine Gazebo, featured many difficult challenges for the state of the art robot control software — navigating rough terrain, operator bandwidth caps, noisy simulated LIDAR data, and getting into and out of a simulated all terrain vehicle. IHMC's approach was solidly grounded in shared autonomy and practical management for large teams of user-interface programmers <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7029992/">[Humanoids 2013]</a>. While I certainly can't claim credit for the wild success of such a large team, I certainly tackled a respectable number of IHMC's agile planning "story cards" including
