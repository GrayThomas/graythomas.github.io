      <p>
        Born in 1989, I received a B.S. from <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College of Engineering</a>, Needham Massachusetts, in 2012—designing my own major in robotics engineering. In the summer of 2012 I joined the <a href="ihmc.us">Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition</a>, and participated in the <a href="http://archive.darpa.mil/roboticschallenge/">DARPA virtual robotics challenge</a>—which we won! Since the fall of 2013, I've been with the <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/">Human Centered Robotics Lab</a> at the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering. Since 2015 I've been a NASA Space Technology Research Fellow, collaborating with <a href="https://github.com/NASA-JSC-Robotics">Johnson Space Center's Robotics Team</a>. I study legged locomotion, the control of compliant robots, system identification (model learning), efficient algorithms, and any math problem that gets in the way! Below are some of my more recent projects and writings.

      <h3>
        ℋ∞ System Identification 
      </h3>
      <p>
        For robots with compliant actuators, feedback controllers are often designed to be energetically passive as a conservative heuristic for stability. To go beyond this performance limit is possible, but the new limit is much more complicated: it is based on how well the actuator and the environment are known.<br>I propose to use ℋ∞ robust control theory to address this problem, which frequently arises in the control of legged robots with series elastic actuators. However, I first need to establish a method for identifying the uncertainty component of the ℋ∞ model—a surprisingly incomplete problem in pure identification and control theory.

      <h3>
        Computationally Efficient Multi-Contact Locomotion Planning
      </h3>
      <p>
        This project explores a numerically efficient planning strategy for legged robots. Luis and I propose to decompose the kinodynamic planning problem into a geometric search for center of mass paths and a dynamic verification of the center of mass path. Geometric search is more tractible than kinodynamic search, and geometric search with an additional feasibility/cost function computation is not all that different from geometric search with obstacles. It also is beneficial to search in a low dimensional space, like center of mass paths, since the curse of dimensionality makes it hard to search larger spaces. Of course this all hinges on the simplicity of the dynamic check and cost evaluation procedure, which is what we focus on.
      </p>
      <p> 
        What we call the "dynamic optimization" includes the selection of foot steps and hand-holds from a finite list of possible contacts as well as the velocity profile over the center of mass path—equivalent to the trajectory in time. Our approach bears similarity both to phase space locomotion planning techniques for bipedal walking and the minimum time trajectory scaling problem for robot arms. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm's efficiency is its use of linear programming with reuse of the active set of inequality constraints. I think that the concept of reusing the active set in repeated optimization problems is a key idea in modern robot control. The videos below give some hint at the algorithm, but the paper is your best bet.

      <h3>
        A Vision of Super-Human Robotic Athleticism
      </h3>
      <p>
      My research focuses on a long term vision for robotics that surpass the grace and dexerity of animals. I don't attack the problem of true robot intelligence, but the problem of instinctual movement and super-human reflexes. I think this robot sub-consious system is key factor holding back the more mechanically interesting robot designs. One of the most interesting aspects of this system is the ability to locomote and manipulate via intermittant contact—walking, running, rotating objects in your hand, et cetera.
