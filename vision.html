      <p>
        My research focuses on a long term vision for robotics that surpass the grace and dexerity of animals. I don't attack the problem of true robot intelligence, but the problem of instinctual movement and super-human reflexes. I think this robot sub-consious system is key factor holding back the more mechanically interesting robot designs. One of the most interesting aspects of this system is the ability to locomote and manipulate via intermittant contactâ€”walking, running, rotating objects in your hand, et cetera.
      </p>

        I see engineering projects as moving first from simple to complex as the problem is understood, and then from complex to simple as the essense of the solution is distilled down. For me, this complex state requires the building blocks of multi-variable control theory, algorithm design, nonlinear optimization, system identification theory, and linear algebra to be understandable. Who knows which aspects will ultimately prove essential in the solution?
